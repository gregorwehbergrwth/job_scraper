You will need a visa to enter Ghana unless you are a citizen of a country that is exempted. Please contact the nearest Ghanaian Embassy or High Commission for a visa to Ghana. 
As an inbound exchange student, your visa is a permit to enter the country at any time during the period it was issued for. On entry into the country, you will be given a number of days at the point of entry to stay, usually 60 days. You are required by law to extend your permit to stay in the country for an extended period of time after that.

If you intend travelling outside Ghana during the semester and return, you are advised to acquire a Multi-entry visa before you first arrive in Ghana.
